# Meme Generator

This project is part of the challenges in the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). It's another fun and practical way I've been sharpening my React skills while building something interactive and engaging.

## About the Project

The Meme Generator is a simple React app that allows users to create custom memes by adding their own text to random images. This project gave me hands-on experience with React’s core concepts and working with APIs to fetch data.

### Features:
- Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Fetching and displaying data from an API
- User input for custom text overlay
- Dynamic image rendering

## What I Learned

This project helped me:
- **Work with APIs**: Fetching data and managing the responses was a great way to understand how to integrate external data sources into a React app.
- **Handle user input**: Managing user input and dynamically updating the UI taught me a lot about controlled components in React.
- **Improve CSS skills**: Positioning text on images and making it look good was a fun challenge.

## Scrimba Career Path Challenges

The Scrimba course continues to provide projects that not only teach the fundamentals but also encourage experimentation and creativity. The Meme Generator was a great way to apply these skills in a real-world context.

### Other Takeaways from the Course
- Better understanding of how to break down a problem into smaller steps.
- Confidence in using React hooks to manage state and side effects.
- Improved ability to debug and test small React apps.
